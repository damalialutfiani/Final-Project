# Final-Project
This is the final project for my D4 program majoring in Telecommunication Engineering at PENS, entitled Collision Warning Detection Analysis Using Vicible Light Communication with C5.0 Algorithm

There are 3 programs used in this final project, namely the Tx Program, the Rx Program, and the C5.0 algorithm program. Tx and Rx programs use Python, while the C5.0 algorithm program uses R.
